>>> 1. Introduction

"prometheus-sumo" is a simple (almost) virtual package, to ease the retrieval of
the various components in the software stack for "prometheus â€“ The Distributed
Digital Image Archive for Research and Studies".

prometheus (www.prometheus-bildarchiv.de) is a digital image archive for Art and
Cultural Sciences. prometheus enables the convenient search for images on a
common user interface within different image archives, variable databases from
institutes, research facilities and museums.

>>> 2. External dependencies

External dependencies are kept to a minimum for this package - further
dependencies, as required when developing the prometheus software packages, are
handled as part of this tool.

>>> 3. Organization of the source code

Once cloning into a working copy has completed, the following directory structure
can be found:

  .
  |-- CMakeLists.txt          ...  Top-level CMake script for the project
  |-- README                  ...  This README file
  |-- cmake                   ...  Collection of CMake scripts and modules
  |-- doc                     ...  Documentation sources (other than source)
  |-- environment             ...  Environment preparation scripts
  |   `-- CMakeLists.txt
  `-- sources                 ...  Source of the project(s)

>>> 4. Configuration options

The behaviour and processing can - to a certain degree - be controlled when
running CMake to configure the project; the list below shows the available 
options which can be passed along through the

  -D<Option>=<Value>

syntax from the command line.

 * ENABLE_TESTING      [YES]
